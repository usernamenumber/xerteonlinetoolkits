Branding Guidelines
===================

The guidelines are not restrictive. The brand is really the 'X' icon, and we'd encourage people to make creative, tasteful use of it. If you are reproducing the text, please use the typefaces noted below.

THe typeface for the 'erte' lettering is Eras Demi ITC.

The typeface for the 'an apereo community project' lettering is Myriad Pro Light Italic. We do not display an apereo logo.

At smaller sizes it is acceptable to leave out the 'an apereo community project' text, as it will be illegible.

At smaller text sizes, the 'X' icon loses definition: substitute it for a standard 'X' in the Eras Demi font.

Both texts can be in any colour to suit both light and dark backgrounds.
